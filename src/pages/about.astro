    <p>
      Indivisible is a nationwide grassroots movement of local groups that formed in response to the need
      to defend democracy and progressive values. We are powered by ordinary people working together
      at the local level to make an extraordinary difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indivisible movement was born from a simple guide written by former congressional staffers
      who wanted to explain how Congress works and how constituents can most effectively influence
      their representatives. That guide spread across the country and sparked the formation of
      thousands of local chapters — including ours here in Idyllwild.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Democracy</strong> — We believe in free and fair elections and the right of every citizen to have their voice heard.</li>
      <li><strong>Justice</strong> — We stand for equal rights and equal treatment under the law for all people.</li>
      <li><strong>Peace</strong> — We work toward a world where diplomacy, cooperation, and human dignity prevail.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We organize locally to contact our elected officials, turn out voters, hold community events,
      and stand up for the values we share. Our committees focus on specific areas including voting rights,
      education, publicity, and membership — working together toward common goals.

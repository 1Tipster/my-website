    <p>
      Idyllwild Indivisible was founded by community members who felt called to action and
      wanted to connect with others who shared their values and commitment to civic engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like thousands of other Indivisible chapters across the country, we formed in response
      to the need to defend democracy, protect vulnerable communities, and hold elected officials
      accountable to their constituents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since our founding, we have organized local events, participated in advocacy campaigns,
      registered voters, and built a community of engaged citizens right here in Idyllwild.
